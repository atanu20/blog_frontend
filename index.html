                    Whether it’s twisting spaghetti around the sauce at a family
                    get-together, sharing egg rolls in front of the TV, or
                    chatting over burgers at your favorite diner, we depend on
                    our food for more than just staying alive: Our fun times,
                    holidays, downtimes, and even professional events center
                    around eating.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Things we also do during these times— smile, laugh, and snap
                    pictures. However, it’s all fun until you look back and
                    notice a yellow or brown smile. (And no, you can't always
                    blame it on the camera filter or lighting.)

                    According to dentists, stained natural teeth can ruin
                    opportunities— and even our quality of life. Here’s what

                    “[It’s] perhaps the first ever feature [people] notice about

                    Look at the positive side: This “first impression” is
                    something we can brighten. By whitening our teeth, we can
                    take years off our appearance and have more confidence in
                    social situations (interviews, sales, dates, and more).

                  the national average for in-office whitening is $650 per
                  appointment. That’s just the average, though— many
                  appointments reach as high as $1,000.

                  It’s a misconception that white teeth are healthier teeth, yet
                  the demand for whiter teeth makes it one of the most expensive
                  areas of dental treatments in the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every year, Americans spend millions on over the counter
                  whitening solutions, whitening toothpaste, whitening gel, and
                  other teeth whitening products.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just right after the highest-costing option (dental office
                  whitening), people have the next option of whitening their
                  teeth at home with whitening kits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of these kits are prescribed by dentists as a more
                  affordable option that delivers office-like results at,
                  perhaps, at a slower pace than the dental office. However,
                  these still range from $100— $400 per kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plus, dental kits are not necessarily all that portable and
                  convenient. In other words, you typically can’t fit them in a
                  small handbag, trouser or shirt pocket, or notebook.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here are the benefits of whitening strips that go beyond just
                  getting a brighter smile:

                </p>
                <p>
                  The obvious choice for those who want whiter teeth— but for a
                  minimum cost— is to use whitening strips. According to the

                  , a box of 20 or more whitening strip treatments costs an
                  average of $30-$50.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Compared to the minimum averages of cosmetic dentist whitening
                  ($650) and whitening kits ($100), whitening strips cost a mere
                  fraction.

                <p>
                  Whitening strips now range in different ingredients and fits
                  available, and you can use them without any other product
                  involved— simply peel, stick, and wait 15 minutes to half an
                  hour (depending on their particular instructions).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is great news if you have an event after work and want to
                  whiten your teeth's surface stains at your desk after lunch,
                  or else while you walk your dog in the park.

                <p>
                  Plus, their whitening process is faster overall compared to
                  teeth whitening toothpastes (and especially a natural
                  whitening toothpaste).

                <p>
                  Whitening strips are discreet and almost unnoticeable. You can
                  drive, take the metro, walk around the store, and talk to your
                  loved ones while you use whitening strips— and few people will
                  even notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i class="fa fa-check text-primary"></i> <b>Portability</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, whitening kits, whitening lights, and
                  even whitening pens require space and planning to bring with
                  you; however, unlike whitening pens and other whitening
                  products, strips can fit virtually anywhere— in your pocket,
                  on the plane, or under a paperclip in your notebook.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <i class="fa fa-check text-primary"></i> <b>Added Safety</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As long as you follow their guidelines and directions,
                  whitening strips are safer to keep around. They don’t require
                  you to keep liquid chemicals like peroxide and bleach sitting
                  around with which a child or infant could potentially harm
                  themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, you’re less likely to swallow and ingest large
                  amounts of bleaching and whitening agent chemicals with
                  whitening strips, in contrast to trays and kits.

                  The first-ever whitening strips came out over 20 years ago— in
                  <a
                    href="https://www.allure.com/story/history-of-teeth-whitening-strips"

                    >2001</a
                  >, when Crest released their first ever disposable plastic
                  strip for whitening teeth.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Since then, whitening strips have become a major part of the
                  teeth whitening and dental hygiene industries. We’ve certainly
                  seen these evolve and expand to different varieties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With all the clutter on the internet, we sorted through and
                  found strips that not only delivered the best results, but
                  also used safe ingredients, were trusted by users, and didn’t
                  cost an arm-and-a-leg.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, we wanted to create an inclusive list from which
                  readers with different concerns, needs, and priorities could
                  find the ideal whitening strip. While some strips prioritize
                  immediate results, others protect sensitive teeth from pain.
                </p>

                <p>
                  That’s why on this list, you’ll find high-powered and
                  fast-acting solutions, something vegan and 100% chemical-free,
                  and options that are ‘semi-natural.’
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also looked for cutting-edge technology that makes strips
                  easy-to-use and possible for people with misaligned / missing
                  teeth.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lastly, we’ve included options that are highly affordable
                  ‘bargains,’ as well as worthy ‘spurges’ for your whitening
                  routine. Overall, we were thrilled to find that the best of
                  the best are still affordable for normal, busy people like
                  yourself.

                  How to Choose Your Ideal Whitening Strips?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Want to know how to get rid of yellow teeth? Here are the 5
                  major things to do before choosing the right strips for you:
                </p>
                <h5 class="fb-600">1. Know Your Teeth Sensitivity Levels</h5>
                <p>
                  Is it painful or uncomfortable to touch something cold (like
                  ice cream, ice, or even a cold beverage) to your teeth? If so,
                  chances are you have sensitive teeth.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you know or think you might have mildly or severely
                  sensitive teeth, you’ll want to look for strips made
                  specifically for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These options will have the keywords “sensitive teeth” on
                  their boxes and descriptions. They’ll also more likely be
                  naturally-based and / or say “hydrogen peroxide-free.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  Many of these products contain a chemical called potassium
                  nitrate to help fight sensitivity of have a lower
                  concentration of peroxides.
                </p>
                <h5 class="fb-600">2. See If They Align With Your Ethics</h5>
                <p>
                  Are you vegan? Well, here’s a news flash: Not all whitening
                  strips are vegan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, some companies test their formulas on animals;
                  by default, such products aren’t vegan.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If vegan and ‘animal cruelty-free’ are significant statuses
                  for you, make sure to buy a box of whitening strips that says
                  so. Otherwise, you might be using something that harmed
                  animals in the process of making it
                </p>

                <h5 class="fb-600">
                  3. Address Teeth Needs & Dental Health Limits.
                </h5>
                <p>
                  For instance, if you have braces, you probably won’t benefit
                  from any whitening strips (until after your braces are
                  removed). In that case, you’ll need your orthodontist’s
                  permission to use a whitening pen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People who wear clear aligners can use whitening strips
                  because they are removable and you can wear them as long as
                  you don’t have attachments that may interfere with the strips.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In addition, if you have recently had dental work done, such
                  as an implant, filling, or tooth capping, you’ll need to ask
                  your dentist first about using whitening strips.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here’s a tip for tooth gaps and misaligned teeth: Teeth that
                  are exceptionally ‘not in alignment’ need a whitening strip
                  designed for flexibility and that can properly fold over teeth
                  that jut out from the rest.
                </p>
                <h5 class="fb-600">4. Consider How Fast You Want Results.</h5>
                <p>
                  Are you just generally wanting whiter teeth, or do you have a
                  special event you want to look ‘optimimal’ for?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Not all strips deliver results at the same speed or treatment
                  number. Unfortunately, a slower results speed typically
                  applies to the ‘all natural’ varieties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, if speed is the main priority, you’ll need a
                  “fast-acting” / “dramatic results instantly” type of whitening
                  strip.
                </p>
                <h5 class="fb-600">
                  5. Be Aware of Treatment Number & the Price Per Treatment
                  (Overall Value)
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Just because a box is cheap doesn’t mean it’s the best deal,
                  and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you plan to share your treatments with a loved one and/or
                  embed whitening into your regular, ongoing dental-care
                  routine, you’ll want to focus on the big picture and overall
                  value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In other words, while an 84-pack for over $50 might seem
                  steep, it actually could save you significant money over time
                  when taking price per treatment ($0.65) into account.

                <h5>- Dissolving Strips With Sophisticated Flavors</h5>
                <p>
                  With over 1,000,000 smiles whitened, these are called “The
                  Magic Strips” for two reasons:
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, they offer professional results at a fraction of the
                  price. Secondly, after 15 minutes, the strips themselves— not
                  just the stains— disappear.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In fact, many users have found that you can get results in as
                  little as 9 minutes a day. The 15-minute duration is actually
                  just the time it takes for the strips to dissolve.

                  Users rave about Snow’s amazing taste, too. While most dental
                  products have boring ole plain mint, peppermint, or cinnamon
                  (if they’re semi-adventurous), this company offers a truly
                  unique, sophisticated flavor: Lavender and mint.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a fan of lavender and a generally curious person, I was
                  very impressed with how this company provides a unique
                  experience to its customers and not just a result.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Snow has a 21-day whitening challenge: “Take our 21 day
                  whitening challenge - whiten for 9 mins per day, every day,
                  for 21 days”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Snow hasn’t been around as long as Crest and other major
                  dental brands; however, it’s certainly proved itself as a
                  dental care company, as it’s also dentist-developed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The founder, Josh Snow, started the company in 2017. They’ve
                  since come out with entire lines of highly-rated teeth
                  whitening products, from their magic strips, to kits, mouth
                  washes, toothpastes, whitening gel, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Snow strived to make something that delivered results
                  comparable to professional treatments, but in the comfort of
                  users’ own homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Snow also didn’t want to contribute additional plastic waste.
                  This is where these stips really stand out. Nearly 99% of
                  other whitening strips brands use disposable, plastic
                  applicators that sit half an hour on your teeth before you
                  plunge them into the trash and, thus, landfills and
                  ecosystems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Snow users don’t worry about contributing unnecessary waste
                  into the environment (at least when it comes to their
                  whitening routines), as Snow’s Magic Strips dissolve within 15
                  minutes or less.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plus, the flavor of these is also something incredibly rare in
                  the teeth whitening industry— lavender. Many users claim that
                  these are so good-tasting that they simply don’t wish to
                  switch to any other ‘boring and typical’ whitening strip for
                  this reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, the dentists who developed these made sure that the
                  magic strip works with most types of dental work like veneers
                  and crowns* and that they cause virtually zero sensitivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  *We recommend consulting your dental professional for use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With wide and inclusive selections, Snow takes care of just
                  about everyone— from those with tooth sensitivity, deep /
                  intrinsic stains, to sophisticated pallets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their high quality comes with the luxury price; however, their
                  site has frequent deals for saving money on these (up to 25%
                  for 6-times-a-year subscriptions).

                    You’ll also notice that they have entire lines of whitening
                    products and kits that compliment their whitening power. You
                    can order mouthwash, a teeth whitening pen, whitening
                    toothpaste, and other products that promote maximum results
                    with the whitening treatments, as well as promote actual
                    dental health (which is, after all, a more important and
                    separate thing from teeth appearance and whiteness).

                    If you’re not as ‘wowed’ as you expected, Snow has a
                    money-back guarantee for 30 days to return. In addition,
                    they offer a 5-year warranty with many of their products.

                  In case you haven’t heard of Crest— it’s a pretty huge, long
                  standing brand. They’ve probably got the biggest and longest
                  reputation for dental care out there, second only to Oral B.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, these strips pack bright results and a huge value for
                  a bargain if you buy them online— 50% discount for online

                <p>
                  While you shouldn’t expect literally the same quality as going
                  to the dentist’s office, these have proven to deliver powerful
                  results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Competitors like Colgate Whitening Strips simply can’t compete
                  with Crest’s best whitening strips. From 4,000 users and the
                  most dentists recommending them, you can safely consider
                  Crest’s 3D Whitening Strips Professional Effects high-quality
                  and trustworthy.
                </p>
                <p>A favorite feature is their “no slip grip.”</p>
                <p>
                  While many whitening strips come with a slimey, sliding
                  plastic applicator, Crest’s uses a special formula that makes
                  the gel stay in place and not slide around your teeth and
                  gums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This makes for a more convenient, hassle-free experience when
                  you want to casually whiten your teeth at home. You can add
                  their whitening toothpaste, whitening gel, and other teeth
                  whitening products to your routine to support the whitening
                  process with the strips.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While that no-slip-grip formula holds its place and prevents
                  discomfort, this also means that the gel is so solid inside
                  these that it’s not getting through to the small, inner cracks
                  in between your teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When applying these, you’ll need to make sure that you gently
                  take your fingernail and press into the outside of the strip
                  into those “cracks” between your teeth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Otherwise, the serum in the strips is so solid that it won’t
                  reach, and you could have slightly yellow / darker areas in
                  between your teeth as a consequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While they still don’t last quite as long or work quite as
                  deep as a dental office whitening session, these take care of
                  coffee, wine, tea, and dark food stains with consistent use.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These powerful effects mean that you won’t want to leave them
                  on longer than the instructions suggest— 30 minutes. If you do
                  that, your teeth and gums could become sore and uncomfortable.
                  If you have tooth sensitivity, you’ll want to cut the wait
                  time in half or so to 15 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can rest assured that these guarantee enamel-safe
                  technology (as long as used within the time recommendations).

                <p>
                  If you’re wanting a brighter smile but are conscious about
                  chemicals and your enamel, Zimba is the ideal natural,
                  sensitive-friendly option.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This pack includes EIGHTY-FOUR strips in their three top
                  flavors (minty teeth, wintergreen teeth, and spearmint teeth).
                </p>
                <p>Yes— you read 84 right!</p>
                <p>
                  Zimba uses natural ingredients like coconut oil to get you
                  fast results without causing discomfort or taking off your
                  enamel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since this pack is so generous and they’re sensitive-friendly,
                  you can use these as often as you want for up to 60 minutes
                  per session.
                </p>

                <p>
                  They’ll also last you a year or more— even if you decide to
                  share them with a partner. That’s even taking into account
                  their only downside— needing to wear them 14 consecutive days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While they boast brighter teeth in just one session, the
                  high-contrast, long term results require you to use them for 2
                  weeks straight. After that, though, you can enjoy the results
                  for up to 6 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This 84-pack is a great deal, as an individual has enough to
                  do this 30 minutes a day, 2-week program every 2 months (or 6
                  times in one year). At the same time, a couple will have
                  enough to do it every 3 months (or 4 times together in one
                  year).
                </p>
                <p>
                  With Zimba, you’ll get pearly whites while protecting yourself
                  and enamel from harsh chemicals. Plus, you’ll only need to buy
                  these one time to be fully set for an entire year.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Don’t forget that these also don’t slip, and they conform
                  comfortably to all smile sizes and alignments. Check them out
                  here.

                <p>
                  These take care of your general oral health with transparent,
                  natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil, sage
                  oil, and dead sea salt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Besides these rare, PRONOUNCEABLE ingredients in these, they
                  also do something rare among whitening strip brands:
                </p>

                <p>
                  They protect your microbiomes (the natural balance of “good”
                  bacteria in the mouth necessary for oral health). Therefore,
                  they don’t use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to do
                  the job.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This essential-oils-based whitening option packs the same
                  convenience and ease as the more typical whitening strips but
                  without the peroxide, harsh bleaches, or alcohol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main thing to keep in mind for these is that because
                  they’re made from essential oils, you’ll need a little
                  patience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because it’s so natural and more gentle, you’ll need to use as
                  directed and not expect dramatic, overnight results like other
                  brands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some people have reported temporary white spots on their teeth
                  after the very first use; however, this has shown to be a
                  temporary issue (most due to the natural base) and resolved
                  itself within the next use or a day.
                </p>

                  🎁 Bonus: Our Top 2 Best Teeth Whitening Kits
                </h2>
                <p>
                  While this is a list for whitening strips, we’ll be honest and
                  say, “Yes— sometimes.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  Strips are more specific, disposable solutions for whitening
                  your teeth that you unwrap, place on your top and bottom rows,
                  and wait for the instructed amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People typically use strips either every-now-and-then
                  maintenance and before special events.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Teeth whitening kits, on the other hand, range more in their
                  forms, benefits, effectiveness, and price. They also tend to
                  deliver faster, yet more gentle, results using LED lights,
                  serums, and trays.

                  <p>
                    The best time to whiten teeth is typically the evening—
                    after you’ve consumed your final beverages and food for the
                    day. This is because dark-toned foods and drinks can
                    actually stain your teeth with worse discoloration than
                    before if you do so right after a whitening session.

                    This is exactly what it sounds like— a diet of white, or
                    color-less, foods and beverages.
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it practical for the long term? Definitely not.</p>

                  <p>
                    Is it necessary right after you finish a whitening session?
                    Most of the time— yes, and at the very least, it helps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After your whitening session, try to eat a “white diet” in
                    the following 1 to 3 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After you use whitening products, your teeth are actually
                    most susceptible to gaining new stains (ironic, right?).

                      Does your face wince up when you try to bite into ice
                      cream?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Does the mere thought of biting into ice give you chills
                      and phantom pain?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If so, you likely have sensitivity and should focus on
                      products that protect your enamel and build strength.
                      Whitening products that promote safe bleaching and protect
                      your teeth from sensitivity with a low concentration of
                      hydrogen peroxide or contain potassium nitrate is your
                      best option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When it comes to whitening sensitivity, the typical
                      chemicals (such as hydrogen peroxide) can be incredibly
                      discomforting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      According to

                        > </span
                      >, hydrogen peroxide acts as a bleaching agent to lift
                      stains and ‘whiten’ your teeth. For teeth whitening, the
                      hydrogen peroxide levels range from 10% to even 40%
                      concentrations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      While dentists and scientists debate hydrogen peroxide’s
                      long term impact on enamel, hydrogen peroxide is known to
                      cause mild or even severe sensitivity to teeth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you already have sensitivity, this added discomfort and
                      pain could get unbearable— making it difficult for hours
                      or even days to be able to drink and eat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You’ll want to stick to brands that are
                      sensitive-friendly, hydrogen peroxide-free, and without
                      other harsh bleaching agents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For the most ideal precautions, choose a natural brand and
                      use them for half the recommended time per session to make
                      sure they don’t trigger your sensitivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A last bit of advice goes towards gum health: If your gums
                      bleed easily or get inflamed, you’ll want to choose a
                      natural whitening strip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Why? Most of the classic bleaching agents (like hydrogen
                      peroxide) can inflame your gums worse and even cause a
                      burning sensation. Opt for a natural, sensitive-friendly
                      whitening strip like Lumineux.

                    If you have stubborn, yellow stains on your teeth, you’ll
                    need to consider consistent whitening treatments and,
                    perhaps, some lifestyle changes and dentist consultations
                    for this issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whether it’s the main, most common culprits like coffee,
                    wine, smoking cigarettes, and dark veggies and fruits,
                    you’ll need to start cutting and adding certain habits.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Limiting or quitting smoking and coffee consumption is
                    overall beneficial to your health, and the staining will
                    discontinue to worsen if you do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One habit you should add is to brush your teeth after
                    consuming colorful drinks and foods. Another is to
                    consistently practice your whitening routine (daily until
                    recommended treatments finish) and to repeat this every few
                    months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If proper and consistent use of whitening strips doesn’t
                    deliver the results you want, you may need to opt for more
                    intense treatments like whitening kits or get a professional
                    whitening procedure at your dentist’s office.

                              For most cases, the best time to use whitening
                              strips is the evening.

                            <p>
                              Because you need to avoid consuming dark foods or
                              beverages right after you use your whitening
                              strips, it’s best to time it out after you’ll be
                              consuming food and drink.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              This is because taking dark foods and beverages
                              such as beets, wine, or coffee after whitening can
                              actually create stains darker than what you had
                              before the whitening strips.

                              the best way to use whitening strips is
                              consistently and by their directions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Popping one in a couple hours before a special
                              occasion is okay; however, consistent, daily usage
                              (following the suggested time / directions and
                              until treatment is complete) will deliver the
                              best, longest-lasting results.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              In addition, you’ll want to lightly brush your
                              teeth with just a toothbrush and water 10 or so
                              minutes before using your whitening strips. This
                              will remove debris and plaque on your teeth and
                              enable the whitening ingredients to more evenly
                              apply to your teeth.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              You also should avoid consuming anything
                              dark-colored for at least 12 hours after doing a
                              whitening treatment.

                <p>
                  Our smiles are the first thing people see about us (in most
                  cases). Even for those with sensitivity, allergies, and
                  restrictions— there’s a whitening strip to boost anyone’s
                  confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you’ll notice, ordering online saves you money, allows you
                  more information and research, and makes it easier for you to
                  return products if you’re not completely satisfied.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Just remember that while these strips and products will boost
                  confidence and ‘glow-up’ your teeth’s appearance, they don’t
                  replace actual dental professional care / advice or good
                  hygiene.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the end, we put all these top whitening strips through the
                  toughest test: Now, here’s how they hold up against one
